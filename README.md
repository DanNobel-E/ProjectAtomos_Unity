## Description

**Atomos** is a 2D shoot 'em up: travel across a synchrotone as an **Hydrogen Atom**, thrown at the speed of light against billions of ions and particles.

## Gameplay

* As an **Hydrogen Atom** take care of your only **Electron** (*yellow*). Fight for survival and overcharge your enemies to defeat them.
* Releasing the **Electron** will damage your enemies, but will also leave you defenseless. Well, who cares? The world is full of **Electrons**! Intercept your enemies' once to recharge your storage.
* **Warning**: as *Atoms*, your enemies will do the same! An uncharged enemy can absorb your **Electron** until its maximum capacity is reached. Then shoot just one more Electron to get another chance of breaking it up.
* Once again, the same goes for you: if your **Electrons** storage is full, next hit will make you lose a **Neutron** (*blue*). All three **Neutrons** gone and the game is lost!

## Grow and Evolve

* Once a while a **Gluon** (*red*) will show off. Take it as soon as you can! When your Atom is full of energy run filling your Electrons storage. Then just throw yourself into an Atom of your same Element and look what happens: your **Hydrogen** has evolved into **Helium**!
* Evolving surely has its benefits. Helium atoms can take two Electrons at once... and you can grow even more! Each step will increase your storage of one Electron. So the game is set: fill your Electron storage, find a Gluon and scale the periodic table.

> Five Atoms evolutions implemented as both enemies and player states:

| Symbol | Full Name | Electrons | Type | Enemy Description |
|--------|-----------|-----------| -----|-------------------|
| **H** | *Hydrogen* | 1 | Shooter |Base Enemy, nice and funny. Hydrogen flows through the syncrothone not caring about anything, but shoots electrons when is bored, so never let the guard down. |
| **He** | *Helium* | 2 | Defender | Posh like its noble gasses friends, Helium lets its two electrons orbiting around as a simple reminder: stay away and it won't bother you. Mess it up and the fault is yours! |
| **Li** | *Lithium* | 3 | Shooter | Rude and lazy but as strong as a rock. It won't be easy taking Lithium down, unless he drags itself off over boredom. |
| **Be** | *Berillium* | 4 | Assault Shooter | Not a quiet buddy to deal with. Fluster and anxiety make Beriullium a bit nervous. The secret is clear as it seems: just run faster. |
| **B** | *Boron* | 5 | Defender| This guy just overthinks a lot! All that bullshit about electronegativity, ionic bonds, you know. Just leave Boron its Electrons and it will flow away like nothing happened. |

## How to Win

* Fun fact: there's no victory, only surviving!
* Collect as much **Electronvolt Points** as you can by defeating other atoms and realeasing their energy through the synchrotone. **That's your call to glory**.
